# Brouhaha

## Description
An iOS app that I am developing and planning to release. Doing some cool suff with AR, Geolocation, and NoSQL.

## Technologies
Swift, ARKit, Firebase, XCode, TravisCI

## Running the Application
* The app must be run on a Mac because of the rules of Apple
1. `pod install` (if you run into issues with this see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14202255/pod-install-bash-pod-command-not-found)
2. Open the .xcworkspace file as a project in XCode
3. Build to the device of your choice

## Running the Tests
Tests can be ran within XCode on the left with the diamond tab with a minus in the middle

## Linting the Project
The project is configured with SwiftLint so that linting messages are displayed within the IDE and whenever the project is built
